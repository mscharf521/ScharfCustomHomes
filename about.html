					<h2>Our Customers</h2>

						<div id="customer-right">
							<p id="Levy" class="testimony testimony-selected">It is a pleasure to write and describe the experience my wife and I had using Scharf Custom Homes to build our home. Since this was the first house we had ever built, we didn't know what the process would be like.<br><br>From the moment we first contacted John Scharf we were impressed with the attitude he brought to his dealings with us. We recognized early on that his approach to building our house was truly a collaborative one. He made it very clear that he wanted to work with us to be sure we understood the design and building of the house. He worked with us to refine the choices we could make, as well as making plain his desire to give us the finest home he could working within our budget.<br><br>John took us several times to a house he had built that was similar in design to the one we were building. This allowed us to see the workmanship and quality of materials to be used for our home. After viewing the design of the house, my wife and I came up with some ideas to customize the design for our needs. John was extremely helpful in working through the design changes and letting us know what the effect of the changes would be.<br><br>Although he was building a number of houses, John was always very accessible during the construction to help us make decisions, answer questions, and make changes to the design. We really felt like we were working as a team to produce the best results.<br><br>It has now been 9 years in the house and it still feels like a new home. The quality and performance of the house has more than met our expectations. We would not hesitate to highly recommend Scharf Custom Homes to anyone wishing a superior product at a fair price.<br><br>If you have any questions we would be happy to speak with your about our experiences.<br><br>Laurence C. Levy, Kirkwood, Missouri</p>
							<p id="Butler" class="testimony testimony-unselected">Dear John,<br><br>We want to tell you how happy we are with our home. Since moving in, we've come to realize what a prize we have. There are details in our home that our friends, who purchased from "big box builders", don't have.<br><br>You were great to work with, a real "custom" builder. We appreciate the time you spent with us, meeting for the short (sometimes long) planning sessions, frequent walk-throughs and those late night calls. You offered suggestions and were open to our suggestions as well. Your attention to detail is impressive, all the things necessary to make a quality home.<br><br>You allowed us to be as involved as we wanted, and helped us make good decisions. We appreciate that the house came in on budget and that there weren't any costly surprises.<br><br>We're so glad you were our builder.<br><br>Robert C. Butler, Kirkwood, Missouri</p>
							<p id="Krause" class="testimony testimony-unselected">Dear John,<br><br>We appreciated your patience during the design and development phase of our house. Your input was valuable in changing the basic design to allow for the type of home that we wanted to build. We were very happy with the final presentation of each room and the unique nature of the rooms. The craftsmen that you selected to construct and complete our home were very professional. Their completed work has provided us many comments regarding how good the look of the house is inside and outside. Thank you for your attention to the details.<br><br>Stephen & Nancy Krause, Chesterfield, Missouri</p>
							<p id="Barnes" class="testimony testimony-unselected">Dear John,<br><br>Working with you was such a pleasure. The attention to detail, creative design, quality control along with your professional manner made the building process an enjoyable experience. We're so pleased with our home and plan to enjoy it for years to come.<br><br>Harry & Mary Lou Barnes, Wildwood, Missouri</p>
							<p id="Super" class="testimony testimony-unselected">As a busy physician having recently completed a rigorous residency and specialty training program and starting into a new private practice, my wife and I with a growing family did not have a whole lot of time to shop for our first home. We had seen a lot of open houses, one of which was a new construction and were overwhelmed by the details of the construction such as the floor plan, quality products and excellent workmanship was readily apparent. We were even more pleased to meet the builder. John took the mystery out of home building. He explained the process and what it involved and we actually found a home site and floor plan that were beyond our expectations. The process was outlined from start to finish. Realistic expectations both emotionally and financially were outlined and basically the construction process was reasonably pleasant. John was exceptionally attentive to our needs and delivered an exceptional product as we had expected. Even after we had moved into our new home, the few odds and ends that needed to be addressed were done so without question or difficulty, even beyond the agreed terms of our contract. Several years have passed and an opportunity for an acquisition of a piece of highly desirable land was available and we did not have any questions in our minds as to how we would proceed.<br><br>Again, we put John to work and from start to finish, including acquisition of the land, development of the architectural plans and complete construction from finish to end, again were essentially seamless. Now more than a year after completion, John has exceeded our expectations. John is exceptionally conscientious, personable, reliable, talented and most of all honest. He has made the process of home-building, which was mysterious, complex, and typically quite aggravating, a good experience.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>David L. Super, D.O.,F.A.C.O.G.<br>Assistant Director of Ambulatory OB/GYN<br>St. John's Mercy Medical Center</p>

						</div>
						<p><strong class="firstLetter">A</strong>&nbsp;custom home starts out as a collection of ideas from you, our client, gathered in your search for the perfect home. Ocassionally, a client will already have a plan drawn by an architect, a perfectly good way to begin. More often, the process starts with an exchange of information. You provide us with your needs, desires, and expectations. We listen carefully, digest this information, then give to you in return our suggestions and cost information.<br><br>Once we are in accord, the creative process is underway. The end result of that creative process is a plan for your home, feature for feature, down to the smallest detail. You will know before one shovel of earth is turned just what your home will look like, exactly where it will sit on your lot, approximately how long it will take to complete and what the cost will be stage by stage.<br><br>Together we will select colors, flooring, wall coverings, fixtures, millwork--everything that will make your home uniquely yours. There are literally hundreds of details that must be planned and executed on a timely basis before we can call a home completed. Once construction begins, you will be kept informed of the progress as the building process procedes. This communication is very important to us-and to you--and is one big reason why we have so many satisfied customers.</p>

					<h2>Renovations</h2>
					<div id="renovations-flex">
						<p><strong class="firstLetter">T</strong>hese days, many people are opting to remodel their existing home rather than buy a new one. If this is the case for you, doesn't it make sense to work with a builder that has the talent and experience to completely build a custom home from scratch? Although this would be ideal, many people mistakenly believe it would cost more for that expertise. With Scharf Custom Homes, it does not cost more.<br><br>In fact, the value is tremendous. You will get the complete focus and attention of John Scharf on your remodeling project, just the same as if he was building your home from scratch. </p>
